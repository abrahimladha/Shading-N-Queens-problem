# Shading-N-Queens-problem

Simple mathematica code to generate a shaded N-Queens board, you can use it to write general solutions, and one is provided. To view the board, simple us arrayplot on the board. This was written for Dr. Brown as part Here are a few examples.

a specific solution of  case of n = 24

Given the opportunity again, I definitely would not do this in Mathematica. The fact I have to include a human readable version says something.
